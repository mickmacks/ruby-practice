# Go Fish - OO Ruby with Tests
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/t0zfcej3qgZeE/giphy.gif" width=200>

In this lab you will be building a card game using Ruby Classes and Rspec Tests. Our game will include classes for: `PlayingCard`, `CardDeck`, `HandOfCards`, and `CardPlayer`. By the end of this lab you should be able to simulate a multi-player game of go_fish.

## Setup
First, make sure you've installed the `rspec` gem.

From the command line (inside the cloned repo directory) run:

```bash
gem install rspec # individually install the rspec gem
# or
bundle install # install all the gems listed in the Gemfile
```

Next, check that the rspec tests are working (they should be failing!):

```bash
rspec
# or
rspec spec/1_playing_card_spec.rb
# or, run only test that match your search
rspec spec/2_card_deck_spec.rb -e "shuffle"
```

## Building the Game

If you're not familiar with the game "Go Fish," take a few minutes to look it up. You can't build something you without understanding it at least a little first!


### Rules of Go Fish

```
SETUP:

Requirements:

    No jokers in deck (52 cards)
    2 or more players

Win 1:
    No more cards in deck.
    Only one player has cards.
    A player has collected all the "books" (all 4 types of a certain card)
    

Win 2: 
    No more cards in the deck.
    More than one player has cards.
    The player with the most "books" wins


DEAL:

    Pick a player to be the dealer
    Pick a player to start (person to left of dealer)

    If player count is 2:
    Deal 7 cards to each player

    If player count is more than 2:
    Deal 5 cards to each player

    Place remaining deck in the middle.

START TURN:

Player 1 (currPlayer) chooses any one card (probably the one they have most of) and then asks any other player "Got any ______?"

If selected player (targetPlayer) has ANY matching cards, they must give currPlayer ALL matching cards they own.

    If currPlayer received a card from targetPlayer, they take targetPlayers card, check if they have any book, and then go again.

    If currPlayer gets a book, they publicly share the info "Collected all four ____s"

If targetPlayer did NOT have any matching cards, they say "Go Fish"

    currPlayer picks up the top card from the deck, and passes. 

    It is now the player to the left of currPlayer's turn.

END TURN

The player to the left of currPlayer is now the new currPlayer.

START NEW TURN

```




We'll be building code that will help simulate one round of Go Fish between two players. That is:

- the first player will ask the second player whether the second player has any of a certain kind of card (like "threes" or "kings") in their hand
- if the the second player has cards that match that description, the first player will take them and add them to their hand
- if the second player didn't have any matching cards, the second player will say "Go Fish!", and the first player will draw a card from the deck

Take a look inside `go_fish.rb` and you'll see some boilerplate code for our classes.

#### Class Interfaces

Your classes will have the following interfaces (take the time to study these closely):

| `PlayingCard` | `CardDeck`    | `HandOfCards` | `CardPlayer`  |
| :----         | :----         | :----         | :----         |
| `initialize`  | `initialize`  | `initialize`  | `initialize`  |
| `rank`        | `cards`       | `cards`       | `hand`        |
| `suit`        | `to_s`        | `to_s`        |               |
| `face`        | `shuffle`     | `shuffle`     |               |
| `to_s`        | `draw`        | `draw`        |               |
|               | `draw_one`    | `draw_one`    |               |
|               | `push`        | `push`        |               |
|               |               | `any?`        |               |
|               |               | `take!`       |               |

Together, these classes and methods will allow us to simulate game play, using the following "Driver Code":

```
# GAME SETUP

puts 'creating a deck'
deck = CardDeck.new
deck.shuffle

puts 'drawing some cards'
card = deck.draw_one
two_cards = deck.draw(2)

puts 'creating hand 1 and player 1'
cards1 = deck.draw(5)
h1 = HandOfCards.new(cards1)
p1 = CardPlayer.new(hand: h1)

puts 'creating hand 2 and player 2'
cards2 = deck.draw(5)
h2 = HandOfCards.new(cards2)
p2 = CardPlayer.new(hand: h2 )


# GAME PLAY

puts 'starting round'
wanted_rank = "3"
puts "p1, do you have any... #{wanted_rank}'s?"
puts 'checking player 1 hand'
if p1.hand.any?(rank: wanted_rank)
    puts 'found card!'
    cards = p1.hand.take!(rank: wanted_rank)
    p2.hand.push(*cards)
else
    puts "Go Fish"
    drawn_card = deck.draw
    p2.hand.push(drawn_card)
end

```

#### Playing Cards
Your first goal will be to build your `PlayingCard` objects. Here's some raw data that you might use later:

```ruby
RANKS = ["A", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "J", "Q", "K"]
SUITS = ["C", "D", "H", "S"]
SORTED_CARDS = [
    "AC", "AD", "AH", "AS", "2C", "2D", "2H", "2S", "3C", "3D", "3H", "3S",
    "4C", "4D", "4H", "4S", "5C", "5D", "5H", "5S", "6C", "6D", "6H", "6S",
    "7C", "7D", "7H", "7S", "8C", "8D", "8H", "8S", "9C", "9D", "9H", "9S",
    "10C", "10D", "10H", "10S", "JC", "JD", "JH", "JS", "QC", "QD", "QH", "QS",
    "KC", "KD", "KH", "KS"
]
```

**Run and read the tests for `PlayingCard` to get started!**

## Tips
It's easy to get lost in test output / lose sight of the "big picture". Make sure you understand what your goal is before you dive in!

You can run your game's Driver Code from the command line by typing:
```bash
ruby go_fish.rb
```

> **Hint**: Take a look at the "Drive Code" at the bottom of `go_fish.rb`!

You can also load your code into Pry to test your assumptions:
```bash
pry
> load 'go_fish.rb'
> card = Card.new({...})
> card.face # "AC"
```
